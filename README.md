# IBM Data Scientist Professional Certificate

## Module 1: What is Data Science 

    Finished Module 1 out of 10 today. Module 1 contains introductary material to understand key terms and ideas that are agreed upon universally. It sets a good foundation for those who are interested in Data Science but are new, not just to the position but the industry as a whole. 

## Module 2: Tools for Data Science 

### Week 1 2023-05-23

    The first week consisted of an introduction to the variety of tools that are used in the different tasks involved in data science. The tasks listed below were covered as a process that data goes through when being manipulated. 
    
    Data Management -  storage, management and retrieval of data

    Data Integration and Transformation - streamline data pipelines and automate data processing tasks

    Data Visualization - provide graphical representation of data and assist with communicating insights

    Modelling - enable Building, Deployment, Monitoring and Assessment of Data and Machine Learning models

## Module 3: Data Science Methodology 

    The Data Science Methodology 101 course, emphasizes the importance of understanding questions and properly applying data in decision-making processes. The methodology, outlined by John Rollins, a senior data scientist at IBM, aims to answer 10 fundamental questions.
        
        1. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
        2. How can you use data to answer the question 
        3. What data do you need to answer the question?
        4, Where is the data coming from and how will you get it?
        5. Is the data that you collected representative of the problem to be solved?
        6. What additional work is required to manipulate and work with data?
        7. In what way can the data be visualized to get the answer that is required?
        8. Does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?
        9. Can you put the model into practice?
        10. Can you get constructive feedback into answering the question?
    
    The course consists of five modules, each covering two stages of the methodology, including explanations, case studies, hands-on labs, and review questions. A healthcare funding allocation scenario is presented as a case study to demonstrate the methodology's application.
